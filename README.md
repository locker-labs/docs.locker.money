### FAQ

Locker provides secure savings and investment functionality for your crypto. When you sign up, we create a "locker" smart account where you maintain ownership but grant Locker limited permissions to transfer funds on your behalf.

Locker enables crypto earners to save and invest automatically. Payments received in a locker are distributed based on your chosen allocations. You can also set savings goals for any large purchase.
